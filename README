*To replicate ColorWave*

1. Get your inital color via HSB values. My inital values were:
- H: 0
- S: 41
- B: 100

2. Use colorpicker.com to get the corresponding hexadecimal value of the color as well as the diametric color.

3. increase either the H value and use the new color for the next div. For a noticeable change in color increase the value by at least 10. 

4. CSS example:
.one {
  width: 2.702%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #FF9696;
  float: left;
}
.one:hover {
  opacity:0.8;
}

.one:active {
  background-color:#96FFFF;
  opacity:1;
}
